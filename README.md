Hey There!
Welcome to my first ever use of SpringBoot-Maven as well As Angular!
This was an insanely fun project and one that really allowed me to get a deep dive into Angular as well as Spring boot
as well as learn a tremendous amount about the two technologies!



1. So basically the java backend work is within /java and you can run the Springboot server by running the
java/snakesladders/src/main/java/maciel/frank/SnakesladdersApplication.java!

2. For the Angular app you can simply go ahead and type 'ng serve' and this should start up the webapp!


Don't forget to give:
- BACKEND_JAVA_DOCUMENTATION.pdf
and
- FRANKS_BRAINSTORM.pdf
A read as well, as this will give you quick insight into the backend as well as what my thinking was
throughout the project on paper.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
